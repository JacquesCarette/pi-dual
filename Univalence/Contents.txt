- FiniteFunctions: basically extensionality for functions on Fin.
- VectorLemmas: lemmas about vectors which are not in the standard library,
   or are there in an inconvenient manner.
- Proofs (FiniteFunctions, VectorLemmas).  
  Useful lemmas about lots of different things.  A kind of Prelude...
- Cauchy (Proofs).  Computational representation of permutations, i.e.
  "semantic" representation.
- Perm
- CauchyProofs
- CauchyProofsT
- CauchyProofsS
- DivModUtils
- Groupoid
- Pifextensional
- Swaps
- Pif (Cauchy, Perm, Proofs, CauchyProofs, CauchyProofsT, CauchyProofsS,
       Groupoid).
    Level 0 (1?) of Pi.  Correspondance with permutations.
    Extensional equivalence.  Groupoid structure.
- Pif2 (same as Pif plus Pif, Swaps)
    Level 2 of Pi.


==========
- VecHelpers (is actually 'old' code, but contains useful stuff which 
    should be reused)
