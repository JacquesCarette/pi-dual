A few comments:

PDF bookmarks:
- the title contains a whole bunch of chinese characters after the official title

Code:
- the code for pf_1 and pf_2, and swap on p.126 should not be centered
- the code after "we list some of these equivalences" on p.129 should not be
  centered

Bibliography:

Citation 17, the names of the authors are:

Citation 19, I think we should keep Md. as the first name not just M.
