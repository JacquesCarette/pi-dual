These are old experiments.  In alphabetical order:
- A.agda: (standalone). U as 0,1,+,*. <-> as syntactic paths between points.
  Paths as dependent type connecting a combinator and 2 points
  Some higher groupoid structure of paths between paths (inverse, trans).
  Int construction.
- A2.agda: (standalone).  Truncated version of A.
- A3.agda: (standalone). Version of A where each path constructor is a 
  separate data type.  Have a certain notion of 'level'.
- A4.agda: (depends on Groupoid).  Verson of A3 with even simpler bottom level.
  attempt at Groupoid structure.
- Ap.agda: (depends on Groupoid). Version of A4 with most of the Groupoid
  structure present.

- Cat.agda (depends on HoTT, FT, FT-Nat, Equivalences and Path2Equiv, which 
    are in different places).  Definition of Setoid, Category, Functors,
    and some examples.  Quite broken.
