Old attempt at showing univalence.  Lots of dead ends here.

- FT [FiniteTypes]. (standalone) Real 0,1,+,* and pi combinators.

- Simplify (FT, HoTT).  Functions to transform some (combinations of) 
   combinators to 'simpler' ones.  Woefully incomplete. 
- NatSimple (FT). Relations between FT and Nat.
- Eval (FT).  Evaluation relation on pi combinators.  Proof of reversibility.
- CombPerm (FT, VecHelpers, NatSimple, Eval, Permutations)
