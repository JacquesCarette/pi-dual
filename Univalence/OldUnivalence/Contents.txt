Old attempt at showing univalence.  Lots of dead ends here.
The nice stuff: TypeEquivalences, LeftCancellation.

- FT [FiniteTypes]. (standalone) Real 0,1,+,* and pi combinators.

- Simplify (FT, HoTT).  Functions to transform some (combinations of) 
   combinators to 'simpler' ones.  Woefully incomplete. 
- NatSimple (FT). Relations between FT and Nat.
- Eval (FT).  Evaluation relation on pi combinators.  Proof of reversibility.
- Permutations (standalone).  Representation of permutations using 
   dependent types (of 'shifts'), combinators and proofs of basic properties.
   Essentially a copy of work by copumpkin.
- CombPerm (FT, VecHelpers, NatSimple, Eval, Permutations)
   hodge podge of combinators on Fin, and relations between Pi and Permutations.
   TODO: Does have some useful lemmas which should be extracted!
- SimpleHoTT (standalone). refl, pathInd, ap, transport, tools for
   basic HoTT.
- Equivalences (SimpleHoTT).  The HoTT version of equivalences.
- Equiv2Path (FT, Equivalences, FT-Nat).  Show equivalences can be 
    translated to pi combinators.
- TypeEquivalences (SimpleHoTT, Equivalences). "semantics space"
   equivalences for all the (syntactic) pi combinators, at the type level.
- Inspect (SimpleHott).  A version of inspect which works with our refl.
- Path2Equiv (FT, Equivalences, TypeEquivalences).  As it says: translate
   paths to equivalences.  Very easy.
- LeftCancellation (SimpleHoTT, Equivalences, TypeEquivalences, Inspect)
   proof that 1+a ~ 1+b => a ~ b.  Quite involved.
- FT-Nat (FT, SimpleHoTT, Equivalences, TypeEquivalences, Path2Equiv,
    LeftCancellation). Relations between FT and Nat.  (some duplication
    from CombPerm here). Normalization of FT.
- FT-Fin (FT, FT-Nat). FT to Fin.
- Obsolete.  Truly obsolete stuff taken from dead-end proof attempts.
- Sane. Splitting of CombPerm, using 'old' representation of permutations
- Sane2.  Sane but with dependently-typed version of permutations.
- UnivalenceFiniteTypes (FT, SimpleHoTT, Equivalences, TypeEquivalences,
   Path2Equiv, FT-Nat, Inspect, LeftCancellation, Equiv2Path).  Dead-end
     attempt at univalence.
