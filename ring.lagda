\section{Computing with Type Isomorphisms}

In a computational model in which resources are carefully maintained,
programs are reduced to type isomorphisms. Although this is apparently a
limiting idea, it turns out that conventional computation can be viewed as a
special case of such resource-preserving isomorphisms that silently consumes
some resources and discards others. This thesis has been explored for many
years from different
perspectives~\cite{fredkin1982conservative,Toffoli:1980,bennett2010notes,bennett2003notes,Bennett:1973:LRC,Landauer:1961,Landauer}.
We build on the work of James and
Sabry~\citeyearpar{James:2012:IE:2103656.2103667} which expresses this thesis in
a type theoretic computational framework. Unlike the case for their
development, we will however not consider recursive types in this paper but
we will develop an extension with higher-order \emph{linear} functions.

\caption{$\Pi$-combinators~\cite{James:2012:IE:2103656.2103667}\label{pi-combinators}}
\end{table*}

The main syntactic vehicle for the developments in this paper is a simple
language called $\Pi$ whose only computations are isomorphisms between finite
types. The set of types $\tau$ includes the empty type 0, the unit type 1,
and conventional sum and product types:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\tau &::=& 0 \alt 1 \alt \tau_1 + \tau_2 \alt \tau_1 * \tau_2 
\end{array}\]
Values $v$ are the expected ones: \lstinline|()| of type 1, $\inl{v}$ and
$\inr{v}$ for injections into sum types, and $(v_1,v_2)$ for product
types.

The interesting syntactic category of $\Pi$ is that of \emph{combinators}
which are witnesses for type isomorphisms of the form $b \iso b$. They
consist of base isomorphisms (on the left side of Table~\ref{pi-combinators})
and compositions (on the right side of the same table). Each line of the
table on the left introduces a pair of dual constants\footnote{where $\swapp$
  and $\swapt$ are self-dual.} that witness the type isomorphism in the
middle. This set of isomorphisms is known to be
complete~\cite{Fiore:2004,fiore-remarks} and the language is universal for
hardware combinational circuits~\cite{James:2012:IE:2103656.2103667}.  If
recursive types and a trace operator (i.e., looping construct) are added, the
language becomes Turing-complete~\cite{James:2012:IE:2103656.2103667,rc2011}
but we will not be concerned with recursive types in this paper.

From the perspective of category theory, the language $\Pi$ models what is
called a \emph{symmetric bimonoidal category} or a \emph{commutative rig
  category}. These are categories with two binary operations $\oplus$ and
$\otimes$ satisfying the axioms of a rig (i.e., a ring without negative
elements also known as a semiring) up to coherent isomorphisms. And indeed
the combinators of $\Pi$ are precisely the semiring axioms. A simple
(slightly degenerate) example of such categories is the category of finite
sets and permutations. Indeed, it is possible to interpret every $\Pi$-type
as a finite set, the values as elements in these finite sets, and the
combinators as permutations.

The previous interpretation of $\Pi$, although valid, misses the point of
taking isomorphisms seriously as \emph{the} essence of computation. Luckily,
an impressive amount of work has been happening in HoTT that builds around
the computational content of equalities, equivalences, and isomorphisms. We
discuss our HoTT re-interpretation of $\Pi$ semantics after we briefly review
some of the essential concepts. The definitive reference is the recently
published comprehensive book~\cite{hottbook}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Condensed Background on HoTT}
\label{hott}

Informally, and as a first approximation, one may think of HoTT as
mathematics, type theory, or computation but with all equalities replaced by
isomorphisms, i.e., with equalities given computational content. We explain
some of the basic ideas below.

One starts with Martin-L\"of type theory, interprets the types as topological
spaces or weak $\infty$-groupoids, and interprets identities between elements
of a type as \emph{paths}.  In more detail, one interprets the witnesses of
the identity $x \equiv y$ as paths from $x$ to $y$. If $x$ and $y$ are
themselves paths, then witnesses of the identity $x \equiv y$ become paths
between paths, or homotopies in the topological language. In Agda notation,
we can formally express this as follows:

\medskip
\begin{code}
data _â‰¡_ {â„“} {A : Set â„“} : (a b : A) â†’ Set â„“ where
  refl : (a : A) â†’ (a â‰¡ a)

i0 : 3 â‰¡ 3
i0 = refl 3

i1 : (1 + 2) â‰¡ (3 * 1)
i1 = refl 3

i2 : â„• â‰¡ â„•
i2 = refl â„•
\end{code}
\medskip

\noindent It is important to note that the notion of propositional
equality~$\equiv$ relates any two terms that are \emph{definitionally equal}
as shown in example \AgdaFunction{i1} above. In general, there may be
\emph{many} proofs (i.e., paths) showing that two particular values are
identical and that proofs are not necessarily identical. This gives rise to a
structure of great combinatorial complexity. To be explicit, we will use
$\equiv_U$ to refer to the space in which the path lives.

We are used to thinking of types as sets of values. So we typically view the
type \AgdaPrimitiveType{Bool} as the figure on the left but in HoTT we should
instead think about it as the figure on the right:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
  \draw (0,0) ellipse (2cm and 1cm);
  \draw[fill] (-1,0) circle (0.025);
  \node[below] at (-1,0) {false};
  \draw[fill] (1,0) circle (0.025);
  \node[below] at (1,0) {true};
\end{tikzpicture}
\qquad\qquad
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
  \draw (0,0) ellipse (2cm and 1cm);
  \draw[fill] (-1,0) circle (0.025);
  \draw[->,thick,cyan] (-1,0) arc (0:320:0.2);
  \node[above right] at (-1,0) {false};
  \draw[fill] (1,-0.2) circle (0.025);
  \draw[->,thick,cyan] (1,-0.2) arc (0:320:0.2);
  \node[above right] at (1,-0.2) {true};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
In this particular case, it makes no difference, but in general we may have a
much more complicated path structure. 

We cannot generate non-trivial groupoids starting from the usual type
constructions. We need \emph{higher-order inductive types} for that purpose.
The classical example is the \emph{circle} that is a space consisting of a
point \AgdaFunction{base} and a path \AgdaFunction{loop} from
\AgdaFunction{base} to itself. As stated, this does not amount to
much. However, because paths carry additional structure (explained below),
that space has the following non-trivial structure:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.78]
  \draw (0,0) ellipse (5.5cm and 2.5cm);
  \draw[fill] (0,0) circle (0.025);
  \draw[->,thick,red] (0,0) arc (90:440:0.2);
  \node[above,red] at (0,0) {refl};
  \draw[->,thick,cyan] (0,0) arc (-180:140:0.7);
  \draw[->,thick,cyan] (0,0) arc (-180:150:1.2);
  \node[left,cyan] at (1.4,0) {loop};
  \node[right,cyan] at (2.4,0) {loop $\circ$ loop $\ldots$};
  \draw[->,thick,blue] (0,0) arc (360:40:0.7);
  \draw[->,thick,blue] (0,0) arc (360:30:1.2);
  \node[right,blue] at (-1.4,0) {!~loop};
  \node[left,blue] at (-2.4,0) {$\ldots$ !~loop $\circ$ !~loop};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The additional structure of types is formalized as follows. Let $x$, $y$, and
$z$ be elements of some $U$:
\begin{itemize}
\item For every path $p : x \equiv_U y$, there exists a path $! p : y
  \equiv_U x$;
\item For every $p : x \equiv_U y$ and $q : y \equiv_U z$, there exists a
  path $p \circ q : x \equiv_U z$;
\item Subject to the following conditions:
 \[\begin{array}{rcl}
  p \circ \mathit{refl}~y &\equiv_{{x \equiv_U y}} & p \\
  p &\equiv_{{x \equiv_U y}} & \mathit{refl}~x \circ p \\
  !p \circ p &\equiv_{{y \equiv_U y}} & \mathit{refl}~y \\
  p ~\circ~ !p &\equiv_{{x \equiv_U x}} & \mathit{refl}~x \\
  !~(!p) &\equiv_{{x \equiv_U y}} & p \\
  p \circ (q \circ r) &\equiv_{{x \equiv_U z}} & (p \circ q) \circ r
 \end{array}\]
\item With similar conditions one level up and so on and so forth.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Space of $\Pi$-Types}

Instead of modeling the semantics of $\Pi$ using \emph{permutations}, which
are are set-theoretic functions after all, we use \emph{paths} from the HoTT
framework. More precisely, we model the universe of $\Pi$ types as a space
whose points are the individual $\Pi$-types and we will consider that there
is path between two points $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ if there is a $\Pi$
combinator $c : \tau_1 \iso \tau_2$. If we focus on 1-paths, this is perfect
as we explain next. 

\paragraph*{Note.} 
But first, we note that this is a significant deviation from the HoTT
framework which fundamentally includes functions, which are specialized to
equivalences, which are then postulated to be paths by the univalence
axiom. This axiom has no satisfactory computational interpretation,
however. Instead we completely bypass the idea of extensional functions and
use paths directly. Another way to understanding what is going on is the
following. In the conventional HoTT framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item We start with two different notions: paths and functions;
\item We use extensional non-constructive methods to identify a
particular class of functions that form isomorphisms;
\item We postulate that this particular class of functions can be
identified with paths.
\end{itemize}
In our case, 
\begin{itemize}
\item We start with a constructive characterization of \emph{reversible
  functions} or \emph{isomorphisms} built using inductively defined
  combinators; 
\item We blur the distinction between such combinators and paths from the
  beginning. We view computation as nothing more than \emph{following paths}!
  As explained earlier, although this appears limiting, it is universal and
  regular computation can be viewed as a special case of that.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Construction.} 
We have a universe $U$ viewed as a groupoid whose points are the types
$\Pi$-types $\tau$. The $\Pi$-combinators of Table~\ref{pi-combinators} are
viewed as syntax for the paths in the space $U$. We need to show that the
groupoid path structure is faithfully represented. The combinator $\idc$
introduces all the $\refl{\tau} : \tau \equiv \tau$ paths in $U$. The adjoint
$\symc{c}$ introduces an inverse path $!p$ for each path $p$ introduced by
$c$. The composition operator $\fatsemi$ introduce a path $p \circ q$ for
every pair of paths whose endpoints match. In addition, we get paths like
$\swapp$ between $\tau_1+\tau_2$ and $\tau_2+\tau_1$. The existence of such
paths in the conventional HoTT developed is \emph{postulated} by the
univalence axiom. The $\otimes$-composition gives a path $(p,q) :
(\tau_1*\tau_2) \equiv (\tau_3*\tau_4)$ whenever we have paths $p : \tau_1
\equiv \tau_3$ and $q : \tau_2 \equiv \tau_4$. A similar situation for the
$\oplus$-composition. The structure of these paths must be discovered and
these paths must be \emph{proved} to exist using path induction in the
conventional HoTT development. So far, this appears too good to be true, and
it is. The problem is that paths in HoTT are subject to rules discussed at
the end of Sec.~\ref{hott}. For example, it must be the case that if $p :
\tau_1 \equiv_U \tau_2$ that $(p \circ \refl{\tau_2})
\equiv_{\tau_1\equiv_U\tau_2} p$.  This path lives in a higher universe:
nothing in our $\Pi$-combinators would justify adding such a path as all our
combinators map types to types. No combinator works one level up at the space
of combinators and there is no such space in the first place. Clearly we are
stuck unless we manage to express a notion of higher-order functions in
$\Pi$. This would allow us to internalize the type $\tau_1\iso\tau_2$ as a
$\Pi$-type which is then manipulated by the same combinators one level higher
and so on.

To make the correspondence between $\Pi$ and the HoTT concepts more apparent
we will, in the remainder of the paper, use \textsf{refl} instead of $\idc$
and $!$ instead of $\mathit{sym}$ when referring to $\Pi$ combinators when
viewed as paths.  Similarly we will use $\rightarrow$ instead of the
$\Pi$-notation $\iso$ or the HoTT notation $\equiv$ to refer to paths.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{First Level of Path Types}

The following extension to $\P$ is motivated by the \textbf{Int}
construction~\cite{joyal1996traced} or the closely related $\mathcal{G}$
construction~\cite{gcons} but differs significantly in some of the details.

Since we are identifying isomorphisms with paths, it follows that in order to
get higher-order functions we need to get (at least) paths between paths. We
therefore extend $\Pi$ with a new type $\onepath{\tau_1}{\tau_2}$ of paths
between $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$. The new type lives in a different universe so
to speak:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\tau &::=& 0 \alt 1 \alt \tau_1 + \tau_2 \alt \tau_1 * \tau_2 \\
\patht &::=& \onepath{\tau_1}{\tau_2}
\end{array}\]
In anticipation of future developments, we will call the original types
$\tau$ 0-dimensional and the new types $\patht$ 1-dimensional. The previous
combinators all work on 0-dimensional types. A 0-level combinator $c : \tau_1
\iso \tau_2$ on 0-dimensional types is a value of the 1-dimensional type
$\patht{\tau_1}{\tau_2}$. We then essentially duplicate $\Pi$ one level up
with lifted versions of the combinators to work on the 1-dimensional
types. 

For convenience, the first order of business is to define a few abbreviations
of 1-dimensional types:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\ztone &=& \onepath{0}{0} \\
\otone &=& \onepath{1}{0} \\
\ptone{(\onepath{\tau_1}{\tau_2})}{(\onepath{\tau_3}{\tau_4})} &= & 
  \onepath{tau_1+\tau_3}{\tau_2+\tau_4} 
\end{array}\]
The level 1 combinators are now exactly identical to the combinators in
Table~\ref{pi-combinators} changing all the 0 dimensional types $\tau$ to
1-dimensional types $\patht$ and hence replacing all occurrences of 0 by
$\ztone$, 1 by $\otone$, and $+$ by $\boxplus$. For reasons explained below,
we have lost the multiplicative structure, so for now we only get the
combinators that only mention additive types. 

\todo{Discuss what this achieves in more detail.}

\paragraph*{The phony multiplication.} 
The ``obvious'' definition of multiplication is:
\[
\ttone{(\onepath{\tau_1}{\tau_2})}{(\onepath{\tau_3}{\tau_4})} \quad=\quad
  \onepath{((tau_1*\tau_3)+(\tau_2*\tau_4))}
          {((tau_1*\tau_3)+(\tau_2*\tau_4))}
\]
This definition of multiplication is not functorial and this turns out to be
intimately related to a well-known open problem in algebraic topology that
goes back at least thirty years~\cite{thomason}. This problem was recently
solved~\cite{ringcompletion}. The main ingredient of this recent solution is
to more paths between paths between paths etc. to express multiplication as
explained next.

We first define the syntax and then present a simple semantic model of types
which is then refined.

\end{figure*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Negative and Cubical Types}

Our types $\tau$ include the empty type 0, the unit type 1, conventional sum
and product types, as well as \emph{negative} types:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\tau &::=& 0 \alt 1 \alt \tau_1 + \tau_2 \alt \tau_1 * \tau_2 \alt - \tau
\end{array}\]
We use $\tau_1 - \tau_2$ to abbreviate $\tau_1 + (- \tau_2)$ and more
interestingly $\tau_1 \lolli \tau_2$ to abbreviate $(- \tau_1) + \tau_2$.
The \emph{dimension} of a type is defined as follows:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\bdim{\cdot} &\hast& \tau \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \\
\bdim{0} &=& 0 \\
\bdim{1} &=& 0 \\
\bdim{\tau_1 + \tau_2} &=& \max(\bdim{\tau_1},\bdim{\tau_2}) \\
\bdim{\tau_1 * \tau_2} &=& \bdim{\tau_1} + \bdim{\tau_2} \\
\bdim{- \tau} &=& \max(1,\bdim{\tau})
\end{array}\]
The base types have dimension 0. If negative types are not used, all
dimensions remain at 0. If negative types are used but no products of
negative types appear anywhere, the dimension is raised to 1. This is the
situation with the \textbf{Int} or $\mathcal{G}$ construction. Once negative
and product types are freely used, the dimension can increase without bounds.

This point is made precise in the following tentative denotation of types (to
be refined in Sec.~\ref{hottypes}) which maps a type of dimension $n$ to an
$n$-dimensional cube. We represent such a cube syntactically as a binary tree
of maximum depth~$n$ with nodes of the form $\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}$. In
such a node, $\cubt_1$ is the positive subspace and $\cubt_2$ (shaded in
gray) is the negative subspace along the first dimension. Each of these
subspaces is itself a cube of a lower dimension. The $0$-dimensional cubes
are plain sets representing the denotation of conventional first-order
types. We use $S$ to denote the denotations of these plain types. A
1-dimensional cube, $\nodet{S_1}{S_2}$, intuitively corresponds to the
difference $\tau_1 - \tau_2$ of the two types whose denotations are $S_1$ and
$S_2$ respectively. The type can be visualized as a ``line'' with polarized
endpoints connecting the two points~$S_1$ and $S_2$. A full 2-dimensional
cube, $\nodet{(\nodet{S_1}{S_2})}{(\nodet{S_3}{S_4})}$, intuitively
corresponds to the iterated difference of the appropriate types
$(\tau_1-\tau_2)-(\tau_3-\tau_4)$ where the successive ``colors'' from the
outermost box encode the sign. The type can be visualized as a ``square''
with polarized corners connecting the two lines corresponding to
$(\tau_1-\tau_2)$ and $(\tau_3-\tau_4)$. (See Fig.~\ref{mult} which is
further explained after we discuss multiplication below.)

Formally, the denotation of types discussed so far is as follows:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\den{0} &=& \emptyset \\
\den{1} &=& \{ \star \} \\
\den{\tau_1 + \tau_2} &=& \den{\tau_1} \oplus \den{\tau_2} \\
\den{\tau_1 * \tau_2} &=& \den{\tau_1} \otimes \den{\tau_2} \\
\den{- \tau} &=& \ominus \den{\tau} \\
\\
\noalign{\mbox{where:}\hfill}
\\
S_1 \oplus S_2 &=& S_1 \uplus S_2 \\
S \oplus (\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}) &=& \nodet{S \oplus \cubt_1}{\cubt_2} \\
(\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}) \oplus S &=& \nodet{\cubt_1 \oplus S}{\cubt_2} \\
(\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}) \oplus (\nodet{\cubt_3}{\cubt_4}) &=& 
  \nodet{\cubt_1 \oplus \cubt_3}{\cubt_2 \oplus \cubt_4} \\
\\
S_1 \otimes S_2 &=& S_1 \times S_2 \\
S \otimes (\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}) &=& 
  \nodet{S \otimes \cubt_1}{S \otimes \cubt_2} \\
(\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2}) \otimes \cubt &=& 
  \nodet{\cubt_1 \otimes \cubt}{\cubt_2 \otimes \cubt} \\
\\
\ominus~S &=& \nodet{\phantom{S}}{S} \\
\ominus~\nodet{\cubt_1}{\cubt_2} &=& \nodet{\ominus~\cubt_2}{\ominus~\cubt_1} 
\end{array}\]
The type 0 maps to the empty set. The type 1 maps to a singleton set. The sum
of $0$-dimensional types is the disjoint union as usual. For cubes of higher
dimensions, the subspaces are recursively added. Note that the sum of
1-dimensional types reduces to the sum used in the \textbf{Int} construction.
The definition of negation is natural: it recursively swaps the positive and
negative subspaces. The product of 0-dimensional types is the cartesian
product of sets. For cubes of higher-dimensions $n$ and $m$, the result is of
dimension $(n+m)$. The example in Fig.~\ref{mult} illustrates the idea using
the product of 1-dimensional cube (i.e., a line) with a 2-dimensional cube
(i.e., a square). The result is a 3-dimensional cube as illustrated.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Higher-Order Functions}

In the \textbf{Int} construction a function from $T_1=(t_1-t_2)$ to
$T_2=(t_3-t_4)$ is represented as an object of type $-T_1+T_2$. Expanding the
definitions, we get:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
-T_1+T_2 &=& -(t_1-t_2) + (t_3-t_4) \\
         &=& (t_2-t_1) + (t_3-t_4) \\
         &=& (t_2+t_3) - (t_1+t_4)
\end{array}\]
The above calculation is consistent with our definitions specialized to 
1-dimensional types. Note that the function is represented as an object
of the same dimension as its input and output types. The situation
generalizes to higher-dimensions. For example, consider a function of type
\[
\nodet{\nodet{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}{\nodet{\tau_3}{\tau_4}} 
\lolli
\nodet{\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6}}{\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8}} 
\]
This function is represent by an object of dimension 2 as the calculation
below shows:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
&& \nodet{\nodet{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}{\nodet{\tau_3}{\tau_4}} 
\lolli
\nodet{\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6}}{\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8}} \\
&=& (\ominus \nodet{\nodet{\tau_1}{\tau_2}}{\nodet{\tau_3}{\tau_4}}) 
    \oplus (\nodet{\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6}}{\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8}}) \\
&=& (\nodet{\ominus(\nodet{\tau_3}{\tau_4})}{\ominus(\nodet{\tau_1}{\tau_2})})
    \oplus (\nodet{\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6}}{\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8}}) \\
&=&     (\nodet{\nodet{\tau_4}{\tau_3}}{\nodet{\tau_2}{\tau_1}})
 \oplus (\nodet{\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6}}{\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8}}) \\
&=& \nodet{(\nodet{\tau_4}{\tau_3})\oplus(\nodet{\tau_5}{\tau_6})}
           {(\nodet{\tau_2}{\tau_1})\oplus(\nodet{\tau_7}{\tau_8})} \\
&=& \nodet{(\nodet{\tau_4\oplus\tau_5}{\tau_3\oplus\tau_6})}
          {(\nodet{\tau_2\oplus\tau_7}{\tau_1\oplus\tau_8})} \\
&=& \nodet{(\nodet{\tau_4\uplus\tau_5}{\tau_3\uplus\tau_6})}
          {(\nodet{\tau_2\uplus\tau_7}{\tau_1\uplus\tau_8})}
\end{array}\]
This may be better understood by visualizing each of the argument type and 
result types as two squares. The square representing the argument type
is flipped in both dimensions effectively swapping the labels on both 
diagonals. The resulting square is then superimposed on the square 
for the result type to give the representation of the function as a first-class
object.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Type Isomorphisms: Paths to the Rescue}

Our proposed semantics of types identifies several structurally different
types such as $(1+(1+1))$ and $((1+1)+1)$. In some sense, this is innocent as
the types are isomorphic. However, in the operational semantics discussed in
Sec.~\ref{opsem}, we make the computational content of such type isomorphisms
explicit. Some other isomorphic types like $(\tau_1*\tau_2)$ and
$(\tau_2*\tau_1)$ map to different cubes and are \emph{not} identified:
explicit isomorphisms are needed to mediate between them. We therefore need
to enrich our model of types with isomorphisms connecting types we deem
equivalent. So far, our types are modeled as cubes which are really sets
indexed by polarities. An isomorphism between $(\tau_1*\tau_2)$ and
$(\tau_2*\tau_1)$ requires nothing more than a pair of set-theoretic
functions between the spaces, and that compose to the identity. What is much
more interesting are the isomorphisms involving the empty type~0. In
particular, if negative types are to be interpreted as their name suggests,
we must have an isomorphism between $(t-t)$ and the empty type
0. Semantically the former denotes the ``line'' $\nodet{\cubt}{\cubt}$ and
the latter denotes the empty set. Their denotations are different and there
is no way, in the world of plain sets, to express the fact that these two
spaces should be identified. What is needed is the ability to \emph{contract}
the \emph{path} between the endpoints of the line to the trivial path on the
empty type. This is, of course, where the ideas of homotopy (type) theory
enter the development.

Consider the situation above in which we want to identify the spaces
corresponding to the types $(1-1)$ and the empty type:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[above] at (0,0) {\pp};
\node[left] at (-0.2,0) {$1$};
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\node[above] at (2.6,0) {\mm};
\node[right] at (2.8,0) {$1$};
\draw[fill] (2.6,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\draw[->,red] (0.1,0) -- (2.5,0);
\draw[->,red] (-0.1,-0.1) arc (135:405:0.2);
\node[below,red] at (0,-0.4) {$\refl{1}$};
\draw[->,red] (2.5,-0.1) arc (135:405:0.2);
\node[below,red] at (2.6,-0.4) {$\refl{1}$};
\node[above] at (1.3,0) {$\seg{1}$};
\node[right] at (1.3,-0.5) {$q$};
%%
\node[below] at (1.3,-1.5) {$\emptyset$};
\draw[fill] (1.3,-1.5) circle [radius=0.05];
\draw[->,red] (1.4,-1.4) arc (-45:225:0.2);
\node[right,red] at (1.5,-1.3) {$\refl{0}$};
%% 
\draw[->,double,blue] (1.3,-0.1) -- (1.3,-1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The top of the figure is the 1-dimensional cube representing the type $(1-1)$
as before except that we now add a path $\seg{1}$ to connect the two
endpoints. This path identifies the two occurrences of 1. (Note that
previously, the dotted lines in the figures were a visualization aid and were
\emph{not} meant to represent paths.) We also make explicit the trivial
identity paths from every space to itself.  The bottom of the figure is the
0-dimensional cube representing the empty type. To express the equivalence of
$(1-1)$ and 0, we add a 2-path $q$, i.e. a path between paths, that connects
the path $\seg{1}$ to the trivial path $\refl{0}$. That effectively makes the
two points ``disappear.''  Surprisingly, that is everything that we need. The
extension to higher dimensions just ``works'' because paths in HoTT have a
rich structure. We explain the details after we include a short introduction
of the necessary concepts from HoTT.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Homotopy Types and Univalence}
\label{hottypes}

We describe the construction of our universe of types. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Homotopy Types}

Our starting point is the construction in Sec.~\ref{cubes} which we summarize
again. We start with all finite sets built from the empty set, a singleton
set, disjoint unions, and cartesian products. All these sets are thought of
being indexed by the empty sequence of polarities $\epsilon$. We then
constructs new spaces that consist of pairs of finite sets $\nodet{S_1}{S_2}$
indexed by positive and negative polarities. These are the 1-dimensional
spaces. We iterate this construction to the limit to get $n$-dimensional
cubes for all natural numbers $n$.

At this point, we switch from viewing the universe of types as an
unstructured collection of spaces to a viewing it as a \emph{groupoid} with
explicit \emph{paths} connecting spaces that we want to consider as
equivalent. We itemize the paths we add next:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first step is to identify each space with itself by adding trivial
  identity paths $\refl{\cubt}$ for each space $\cubt$;
\item Then we add paths $\seg{\cubt}$ that connect all occurrences of the
  same type $\cubt$ in various positions in $n$-dimensional cubes. For
  example, the 1-dimensional space corresponding to $(1-1)$ would now include
  a path connecting the two endpoints as illustrated at the end of 
  Sec.~\ref{cubes}.
\item We then add paths for witnessing the usual type isomorphisms between
  finite types such as associativity and commutativity of sums and
  products. The complete list of these isomorphisms is given in the next
  section.
\item Finally, we add \emph{2-paths} between $\refl{0}$ and any path
  $\seg{\cubt}$ whose endpoints are of opposite polarities, i.e., of
  polarities $s$ and $\negp{s}$ where:
  \[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \negp{\epsilon} &=& \epsilon \\
  \negp{+s} &=& -\negp{s} \\
  \negp{-s} &=& +\negp{s}
  \end{array}\]
\item The groupoid structure forces other paths to be added as described in
  the previous section. 
\end{itemize}

Now the structure of path spaces is complicated in general. Let's look at
some examples.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Univalence} 

The heart of HoTT is the \emph{univalence axiom}, which informally states
that isomorphic structures can be identified. One of the major open problems
in HoTT is a computational interpretation of this axiom. We propose that, at
least for the special case of finite types, reversible computation \emph{is}
the computational interpretation of univalence. Specifically, in the context
of finite types, univalence specializes to a relationship between type
isomorphisms on the side of syntactic identities and permutations in the
symmetric group on the side of semantic equivalences. 

In conventional HoTT:

\begin{code}
-- f âˆ¼ g iff âˆ€ x. f x â‰¡ g x
_âˆ¼_ : âˆ€ {â„“ â„“'} â†’ {A : Set â„“} {P : A â†’ Set â„“'} â†’ 
      (f g : (x : A) â†’ P x) â†’ Set (â„“ âŠ” â„“')
_âˆ¼_ {â„“} {â„“'} {A} {P} f g = (x : A) â†’ f x â‰¡ g x

-- f is an equivalence if we have g and h 
-- such that the compositions with f in 
-- both ways are âˆ¼ id

  Set (â„“ âŠ” â„“') where

    g : B â†’ A 
    Î± : (f âˆ˜ g) âˆ¼ id

-- Two spaces are equivalent if we have 
-- functions f, g, and h that compose

  univalence : {A B : Set} â†’ (A â‰¡ B) â‰ƒ (A â‰ƒ B)
\end{code}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{A Reversible Language with Cubical Types} 
\label{opsem}

We first define values then combinators that manipulate the values to witness
the type isomorphisms.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Values} 

Now that the type structure is defined, we turn our attention to the notion
of values. Intuitively, a value of the $n$-dimensional type $\tau$ is an
element of one of the sets located in one of the corners of the
$n$-dimensional cube denoted by $\tau$ (taking into that there are non-trivial
paths relating these sets to other sets, etc.) Thus to specify a value, we must
first specify one of the corners of the cube (or equivalently one of the
leaves in the binary tree representation) which can easily be done using a
sequence $s$ of $+$ and $-$ polarities indicating how to navigate the cube in
each successive dimension starting from a fixed origin to reach the desired
corner. We write $v^{s}$ for the value $v$ located at corner $s$ of the cube
associated with its type. We use $\epsilon$ for the empty sequence of
polarities and identify $v$ with $v^\epsilon$. Note that the polarities
doesn't completely specify the type since different types like $(1+(1+1))$
and $((1+1)+1)$ are assigned the same denotation. What the path $s$ specifies
is the \emph{polarity} of the value, or its ``orientation'' in the space
denoted by its type. Formally:
\[\begin{array}{c}
\infer{() : 1}{} 
\qquad
\infer[\textit{neg}]{v^{\negp{s}} : - \tau}{v^s : \tau} 
\\
\infer[\textit{left}]{(\inl{v})^{s} : \tau_1 + \tau_2}{v^{s} : \tau_1}
\qquad
\infer[\textit{right}]{(\inr{v})^{s} : \tau_1 + \tau_2}{v^{s} : \tau_2} 
\\
\infer[\textit{prod}]{(v_1,v_2)^{s_1 \cdot s_2} : \tau_1 * \tau_2}
      {v_1^{s_1} : \tau_1 & v_2^{s_2} : \tau_2} 
\end{array}\]
The rules \textit{left} and \textit{right} reflect the fact that sums do not
increase the dimension. Note that when $s$ is $\epsilon$, we get the
conventional values for the 0-dimensional sum type. The rule \textit{prod} is
the most involved one: it increases the dimension by \emph{concatenating} the
two dimensions of its arguments. For example, if we pair $v_1^{\pp}$ and
$v_2^{\mm\pp}$ we get $(v_1,v_2)^{\pp\mm\pp}$. (See Fig.~\ref{mult} for the
illustration.) Note again that if both components are 0-dimensional, the pair
remains 0-dimensional and we recover the usual rule for typing values of
product types. The rule \textit{neg} uses the function below which states
that the negation of a value $v$ is the same value $v$ located at the
``opposite'' corner of the cube.

then follow that a square where one edge 
contracts to a point would itself contract 
to a line, and a 3-dimensional cube 
in which one face contracts to a point 
would itself contract to a square, etc. 

Now consider (a-b)-(c-c). We have a 
path to (a-b)-0 that contracts the
path between c and -c. We want to 
reduce the dimension of that space
and map to (a-b).

epsilon should take one and map
to the other because it can
never produce something of type 0

In general, we have several direction

Int construction. In 3D we have
8 directions: +++, ++-, ..., ---
We have an epsilon that 
takes ++- and flips it to --+
and another that flips
+++ to --- and so on

So we should have 8 interpreters
for 3D one for each direction!!!

The ++- interpreter would 
manipulates values like
(v1,v2,v3) and would apply
the normal combinators to v1, v2, 
and the adjoint to v3 and so on.

To complete the story we need to 
define morphisms. (More on this below.)
Once we have a notion of morphism we 
can check whether X + 0 is the same
as X etc. i.e., we can check all the 
ring equivalences. 

Ok so what are the morphisms between 
these cubical objects? We know what
they are for 1-dimensional cubes: 
they are the pi combinators. We also
know what they are for the 2-dimensional 
cubes: a maps (A-B) ==> (C-D) 
is a Pi map between A+D <=> C+B. 
How to generalize this? 

Why is there no trace in the ring 
completion paper??? What are 
the morphisms in that paper?

The ring completion paper produces
a simplicial category.

p. 3 talks about the group cancellation
as subcubes along the diagonal... 

We shouldn't focus on denotations. We want
an operational semantics for pi with 
negatives. The same way that Neel turned
the G construction into code that does
something neat; we want to turn that 
ring completion construction into code
that produces h.o. functions without
losing the multiplicative structure.

Show how to embed a square in 2D into
each of the faces of the 3D cube.

1D into 2D:

(a-b) => (a-b)-(0-0)
(a-b) => (a-0)-(b-0)
(a-b) => (0-b)-(0-a)
(a-b) => (0-0)-(b-a)


We only have -
which flips ALL the directions simultaneously.
So from ++-+--+ you can only go to
        --+-++-
What if you wanted to go to
        ++++--+
I think we use the * functor to flip the 
direction we want. 

\subsection{Combinators: Example} 

Consider the following simple function on 0-dimensional sum types:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
\textsf{swapP} &\hast& (\tau_1 + \tau_2) \rightarrow (\tau_2 + \tau_1) \\
\textsf{swapP} (\inl{v}) &=& inr{v} \\
\textsf{swapP} (\inr{v}) &=& inl{v}
\end{array}\]
Given our setup, this just works $n$-dimensional types. And so do most of the
$\Pi$ combinators for that matter. Only $\eta$ and $\epsilon$ seem to need
thinking. How and why would $1-1$ which is a 1-dimensional line be the same
as the empty type which is a 0-dimensional thing. And how do we generalize
for arbitrary group identities at higher dimensions. We need a mechanism for
cubes with subspaces that ``cancel'' to map to equivalent smaller subcubes.

\subsection{Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item A function from space $A$ to space $B$ must map the points of $A$
to the points of $B$ as usual but it must also \emph{respect the path
structure};
\item Logically, this corresponds to saying that every function
respects equality;
\item Topologically, this corresponds to saying that every function is
continuous.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathit{ap}~f~p$ is the action of $f$ on a path $p$;
\item This satisfies the following properties:
  \[\begin{array}{rcl}
  \mathit{ap}~f~(p \circ q) &\equiv&
                (\mathit{ap}~f~p) \circ (\mathit{ap}~f~q) \\

Type families as fibrations. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A more complicated version of the previous idea for dependent
functions;
\item The problem is that for dependent functions, $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ may
not be in the same type, i.e., they live in different spaces;
\item Idea is to \emph{transport} $f(x)$ to the space of $f(y)$;
\item Because everything is ``continuous'', the path $p$ induces a
transport function that does the right thing: the action of $f$ on $p$
becomes a path between $\mathit{transport}~(f(x))$ and $f(y)$.

Before we define the construction in any detail, let's take one simple
example $\identlp : 0+1 \iso 1$ and see how to represent as a value of type
$1-(0+1)$. We visually represent the type itself as a line with 0-dimensional
types attached at the endpoints (which are distinguished by polarities):
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[above] at (0,0) {\pp};
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\node[above] at (2.6,0) {\mm};
\draw[fill] (2.6,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\draw[-,dotted] (0,0) -- (2.6,0);
\draw (0,-1.1) ellipse (0.5cm and 1cm);
\draw (2.6,-1.1) ellipse (0.5cm and 1cm);
\node at (0,-1.1) {1};
\node at (2.6,-1.1) {0+1};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The value representing $\identlp$ is simply:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[above] at (0,0) {\pp};
\draw[fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\node[above] at (2.6,0) {\mm};
\draw[fill] (2.6,0) circle [radius=0.05];
\draw[-,dotted] (0,0) -- (2.6,0);
\draw (0,-1.1) ellipse (0.5cm and 1cm);
\draw (2.6,-1.1) ellipse (0.5cm and 1cm);
\draw[->,thick,blue] (2.0,-1.1) -- (0.6,-1.1);
\node[above] at (1.3,-1.1) {$\identlp$};
\node at (0,-1.1) {1};
\node at (2.6,-1.1) {0+1};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
This entire package is a value, an atomic entity with invisible internal
structure and that can only be manipulated via the level 1 combinators
described next.

Most of the time, the level 1 combinators are oblivious to the fact that they
are manipulating first class functions. Formally, the action of a level 1
combinator of type $(\tau_1-\tau_2) \isoone (\tau_3-\tau_4)$ is derived from
the action of 0 level combinators of type $(\tau_1+\tau_4) \iso
(\tau_3+\tau_2)$. Thus to take a trivial example $\identlp^1 : \ztone
\boxplus \cubt \isoone \cubt$ is realized as $\assocrp \fatsemi (\idc \oplus
\swapp) \fatsemi \assoclp$ which evidently knows nothing specific about
higher order functions. The interesting idea is that it is possible to define
a new level 1 combinator that exposes the internal structure of values as
functions:
\[\begin{array}{rrcll}
\eta :&  0-0 & \isoone & \tau - \tau &: \varepsilon 
\end{array}\]
What this does is essentially provide an input and output port which are
connected by the internal hidden function.
