  abstract =     "Any multiprocessing facility must include three
                 features: elementary exclusion, data protection, and
                 process saving. While elementary exclusion must rest on
                 some hardware facility (e.g.\ a test-and-set
                 instruction), the other two requirements are fulfilled
                 by features already presented in applicative languages.
                 Data protection may be obtained through the use of
                 procedures (closures or funargs), and process saving
                 may be obtained through the use of the CATCH operator.
                 The use of CATCH, in particular, allows an elegant
                 treatment of process saving. We demonstrate these
                 techniques by writing the kernel and some modules for a
                 multiprocessing system. The kernel is very small. Many
                 functions which one would normally expect to find
                 inside the kernel are completely decentralized. We
                 consider the implementation of other schedulers,
                 interrupts and the implications of these ideas for
                 language design.",

                 implementing a variety of control structures, including
                 exception handling facilities and breadth-first
                 searching algorithms. However, traditional
                 continuations are not useful in the presence of
                 concurrency, because the notion of the rest of the
                 computation represented by a continuation does not in
                 general make sense. This paper presents a new type of
                 continuation, called a {\em process continuation\/},
                 that may be used to control tree-structured
                 concurrency. Just as a traditional continuation
                 represents the rest of a computation from a given point
                 in the computation from a given point in the
                 computation, a process continuation represents the rest
                 of a {\em subcomputation\/}, or {\em process\/}, from a
                 given point in the {\em subcomputation\/}. Process
                 continuations allow nonlocal exits to arbitrary points
                 in the process tree and allow the capture of a subtree
                 of a computation as a composable continuation for later
                 use. Even in the absence of multiple processes, the
                 precise control achievable with process continuations
                 makes them more useful than traditional
                 continuations.",

  abstract =     "Any multiprocessing facility must include three
                 features: elementary exclusion, data protection, and
                 process saving. While elementary exclusion must rest on
                 some hardware facility (e.g.\ a test-and-set
                 instruction), the other two requirements are fulfilled
                 by features already presented in applicative languages.
                 Data protection may be obtained through the use of
                 procedures (closures or funargs), and process saving
                 may be obtained through the use of the CATCH operator.
                 The use of CATCH, in particular, allows an elegant
                 treatment of process saving. We demonstrate these
                 techniques by writing the kernel and some modules for a
                 multiprocessing system. The kernel is very small. Many
                 functions which one would normally expect to find
                 inside the kernel are completely decentralized. We
                 consider the implementation of other schedulers,
                 interrupts and the implications of these ideas for
                 language design.",

                 implementing a variety of control structures, including
                 exception handling facilities and breadth-first
                 searching algorithms. However, traditional
                 continuations are not useful in the presence of
                 concurrency, because the notion of the rest of the
                 computation represented by a continuation does not in
                 general make sense. This paper presents a new type of
                 continuation, called a {\em process continuation\/},
                 that may be used to control tree-structured
                 concurrency. Just as a traditional continuation
                 represents the rest of a computation from a given point
                 in the computation from a given point in the
                 computation, a process continuation represents the rest
                 of a {\em subcomputation\/}, or {\em process\/}, from a
                 given point in the {\em subcomputation\/}. Process
                 continuations allow nonlocal exits to arbitrary points
                 in the process tree and allow the capture of a subtree
                 of a computation as a composable continuation for later
                 use. Even in the absence of multiple processes, the
                 precise control achievable with process continuations
                 makes them more useful than traditional
                 continuations.",
