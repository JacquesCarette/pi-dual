  abstract  = "Bidirectional transformations (BX) serve to maintain consistency between different representations of related and often overlapping information, translating changes in one representation to the others. We present a brief introduction to the field, in order to provide some common background to the remainder of this volume, which constitutes the lecture notes from the Summer School on Bidirectional Transformations, held in Oxford in July 2016 as one of the closing activities of the UK EPSRC-funded project A Theory of Least Change for Bidirectional Transformations.",
